This example of SOLID code is inspired by the Medium article, [Solid Design Principles Makes Test Driven Development Faster and Easier](https://medium.com/ibm-garage/solid-design-principles-makes-test-driven-development-faster-and-easier-35c9eec22ff1).

The example is written in both Java as well as JavaScript and demonstrates that the concepts of encapsulation, single responsibility, open-closed principle, liskov substitution, interface segregation, and the dependency injection principle can be utilized in both Java and JavaScript.

The same can be done in Node.js, Python, C#, Visual Basic, C++, PHP and many other functional and object-oriented languages.

To run the Java example, in IntelliJ or Eclipse, run the Main.java class. To run the JavaScript example, start a simple web server pointing to the webapp folder.  I recommend the Node.js http-server:

Install http-server
```
$ npm install -g http-server
```

Run http-server:
```
$ http-server -p -8091 webapp
```

Then browse to [http://localhost:8091](http://localhost:8091)
